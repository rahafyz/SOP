	<p id="box-sop">
		We are currently in the midst of a technological revolution that will drastically change our lives and potentially redefine what it means to be human. I am very excited at the prospect of devoting my long-term career to such a dynamic, fast advancing field. Ever since I was young, I have enjoyed dabbling with computers and experimenting with different applications. Because my own lifetime has essentially coincided with the rise of the modern technology industry, I can sense that there are still tremendous developments to come in this field. It was natural for me to choose Computer Engineering as my university major, and now, as I near the end of my undergraduate studies, it is my central goal to continue my education in a more competitive, elite, and international environment.
		<br>
        My academic experience thus far has provided me with a wide range of practical knowledge and skills that will be immensely useful when studying at the graduate level.As an undergraduate, I found that I deeply enjoyed learning about programming and systems analysis, and with my strong mathematics background I performed very well in courses concerning calculus, statistics, and differential equations. Now, in addition to my specialized knowledge of programing, I have an appreciation for the breadth of this field and the nearly endless possibilities for further study.
        <br>
        This industry is rapidly growing and shows great potential, yet compared to other, more advanced countries it is still in its relative infancy. By studying in your masterâ€™s program I expect to have the expertise, the perspective, and the experience necessary to lead our industry to a new era. I also have many friends with similar goals, and I hope that we can one day collaborate to put our country on the map as an innovative force in the computing world.
